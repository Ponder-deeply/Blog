I've been learning python for a month or so on coursera.org. I've been working on completing a course bundle called Python for Everybody, to get my foot in the door of
programming agin. The problem is, it's been getting a bit stale, just learning, and only writing small bits of code here and there. So I decided to start some small
projects. These will hopefully help with getting my enthusiasm back, and also serve as some very useful experience.

My first project will be building a really dumb crypto trading bot. Yeah... pretty ambitious for a 'first project' but still, it should be fun.
I will be using all kinds of resources for this project and will try to link the most useful ones among them.

For starters let's get some goals on here,
The trading bot should be able to:
  connect to a crypto trading site (crypto.com or etoro, unsure as of yet)
  fetch the data of a cryptocurrency
  invest in well known crypto (Ethereum,Bitcoin,BNB)
