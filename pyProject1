I've been learning python for a month or so on coursera.org. I've been working on completing a course bundle called Python for Everybody, to get my foot in the door of
programming agin. The problem is, it's been getting a bit stale, just learning, and only writing small bits of code here and there. So I decided to start some small
projects. These will hopefully help with getting my enthusiasm back, and also serve as some very useful experience.

My first project will be building a really dumb crypto trading bot. Yeah... pretty ambitious for a 'first project' but still, it should be fun.
I will be using all kinds of resources for this project and will try to link the most useful ones among them.

I have opened a new project and will be writing information regarding it over there, and this will simply serve as a reminder to when and why this project was started.
