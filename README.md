# Blog
My name is Barnabas and I started this blog to keep track of my progress. I also created it to remind myself of stuff, as I can be quite forgetful.  

This blog will probably be mostly .md files but it might also have some code attached to it. It will also contain my opinions, restriced to the matter at hand of course. Well, maybe not always.  

Who knows, this might either be a long and confusing read, or just a stub with barely any information in it. Anyways, my good reader, I haven't the slightest idea who you are or why you are here, but I wish you good luck on your journey through these thoughts of mine.
